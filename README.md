# Badger
  A simple creation tool & display library for making "badges" that display the dependency
  projects of a project, similar to Google Chrome's chrome://credits page.

  * Enter a project name, homepage link, and license link, and then press "Apply" to see how it looks/test it.
  * Press "Add" to add a badge to your list of badges once it's ready.
  * Press "Export" to copy the HTML code of the badge list to your clipboard so you can paste it into your own code.
  * Paste the code into the page's source code.
  * Include the badger.css stylesheet in the page where you want the badge(s) displayed.
